This is all backward looking.\n","\n","The primary goal is to help us understand the firm's context which in turn helps us understand how to best make projections into the future. This is not the only analysis we need, but we do need it.\n","\n","The focus will be on key valuation metrics:\n","* Growth Rates\n","* Margins\n","* Reinvestment\n","\n","## Plan\n","\n","1. Get Income Statement data: Revenue and EBIT. Compute growth rates in both for as long a history as we can (4 years for Yahoo)\n","2. Compute EBIT Margin (EBIT/Revenue) and Gross Margin (Gross Profit/Revenue)\n","3. Get Balance Sheet data to compute NWC and Change in NWC\n","4. Get Statement of Cash Flows to get Capital Expenditures and Depreciation & Amortization.\n","5. Compute Reinvestment = CapEx - D&A + Change in NWC\n","6. Compute FCF, NOPAT and Reinvestment Rate = Reinvestment/NOPAT\n","\n","\n","This is our in-class project that we will work on progressively through the mod.\n","\n","Expectations:\n","1. Notebook is clean and neat, with no repeated code. It has clearly labeled sections for inputs/imports at the beginning. Code is sufficiently commented to demonstrate your understanding of the code and help you or anyone else who may use this code later. All numbers should be formatted so they are readable (so, use commas with large numbers, only a few decimal points).\n","2. All calculations are correct and all discussion questions are answered completely but concisely, demonstrating a depth of understanding.\n","\n","Workflow:\n","1. Notebooks are inherently experimental and allow you to try things, however that requires some good habits\n","2. Once you are \"done\" in any sense, you always need to \"clean up\" your notebook to make it presentable. You'd do the same in Excel - you've tried lots of things, etc. but before you present it, you clean it up.\n","3. Finally, restart the Runtime/Kernel and run it cleanly all the way top to bottom one time.\n","\n","Then, its ready to go.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pdkJMU5DSeUK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1
